Face Recognition System
This project implements a real-time face recognition system using OpenCV. It captures images, trains a face recognition model using the LBPH algorithm, and recognizes faces in live video streams.

Features
Capture Faces: Captures face images and stores them in a dataset.
Train Model: Trains a face recognition model using the LBPH algorithm.
Real-Time Recognition: Recognizes faces in real-time using a webcam.

Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-system.git
cd face-recognition-system
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy
Download Haarcascade: The script uses OpenCV's pre-trained haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml. Ensure it is available in your OpenCV installation:

kotlin
Copy code
cv2.data.haarcascades
Run the Scripts:

Capture Images: Uncomment and run the capture_images function:

python
Copy code
capture_images('YourName')
Press q to stop capturing after the required number of images.

Train the Model: Use the train_model function to train the face recognition model:

python
Copy code
recognizer = train_model(label)
Recognize Faces: Call the recognize_faces function to start recognizing faces in real-time:

python
Copy code
recognize_faces(recognizer, label)
Usage
Run the script to capture face images.
Train the model using the captured images.
Use the trained model for real-time face recognition.
Customization
Add More Users:

Update the label dictionary with new user names and IDs.
Capture new user images using capture_images('NewUserName').
Adjust Parameters:

Change scaleFactor, minNeighbors, and minSize in face_cascade.detectMultiScale() for better face detection accuracy.
Notes
Ensure proper lighting while capturing face images for accurate recognition.
The system uses the LBPH algorithm, suitable for small datasets and local recognition tasks.
Demo
Include a screenshot or GIF of the system in action if possible.
